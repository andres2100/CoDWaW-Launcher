# CoDWaW-Launcher
source and releases for it

this is a Call of duty 5: World At War Launcher,
very simple made, used c#. this is the first
thing i do that saves the configs, it uses
poor methods to work but, it works!.
you can choose if execute it with fullscreen
or not, and also you can choose a mods to
launch. 
also sorry not sure if i will upload source code even if the desc
says it has desc, but it says "the file is empty" when i do it, so
ill try to fix it

# enjoy
