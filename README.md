# CoDWaW-Launcher
source and releases for it

this is a Call of duty 5: World At War Launcher,
very simple made, used visual studio windows forms c#. this is the first
thing i do that saves the configs, it uses
poor methods to work but, it works!.
you can choose if execute it with fullscreen
or not, and also you can choose a mod to
launch. 
also sorry not sure if i will upload source code even if the desc
says it has source, but it says "the file is empty" when i do it, so
ill try to fix it

# Update

i forgot this was a thing, the version on github is old so i will update that soon, and also
yes i now know how to use github so i will put the source code if soemone for some weird
reason needs it

# enjoy
